#' Package 'smoothscale'
#'
#' **smoothscale** contains two functions for
#' simple small area estimation:
#' - [smooth_prob()] deals with sampling error in probabilities
#'   by pulling them towards an overall average
#' - [scale_prob()] deals with measurement error in probabilities
#'   by scaling them to be consistent with a (reliable)
#'   overall total!
#'
#' **smoothscale** also contains a synthetic dataset
#' called [syn_census].
